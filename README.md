## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
creat a repositori in git hub , clone it on the v code and create branche and switch from the master to the validate contact form branch
add index.html.
add styles.css.
add javascript file main.js
add  files readme , linters file , stylelintrc.json, package.json.
coding the html code and css style to make the desktop version portfolio


### Setup
after that i created a branch a validate contact form branch  and i switched it from master .

### Install
I clone it by using the git bash inside the folder of my portfolio.
### Usage
i have made my mobile menu project by html and styles css and javascript files  creating the index.html and styles.css files.
in the main.js and main.js I added the code of java script to make the validate contact form working normaly.
so When the user submits the form, you check if the email is in lower case.
If the validation is OK, the form is sent.
If the validation is not OK, you show an error message to the user near the submit button informing them of the error and the form is not sent.

i added all the files readme , linters file , stylelintrc.json, package.json.
### Run tests
i used the command git add .
git commit
git push
